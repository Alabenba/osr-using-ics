# Open-Set Recognition Using Intra-Class Splitting

This repository contains an implementation of an open-set recognition method using deep learning. The method was proposed in our "Open-Set Recognition Using Intra-Class Splitting" paper presented at the IEEE European Signal Processing Conference 2019. It is based on intra-class splitting, i.e. splitting given normal samples into typical and atypical subsets:
